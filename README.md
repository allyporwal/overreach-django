# OVERREACH

## Full Stack Frameworks With Django Milestone Project

<hr>

Welcome to Overreach.

Overreach is a web app that is intended to serve two main purposes:

1. Give users a place to log their strength training workouts
2. Serve as a place that users can connect with other strength training enthusiasts

The app was deployed using Heroku and can be found here: [Overreach](https://overreach.herokuapp.com)

This is my final milestone project for the Code Institute Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. It will be something I continue working on as a hobby (in a cloned repository) after submitting to further develop my skills in full stack software development.
