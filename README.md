## Full Stack Frameworks With Django Milestone Project

<hr>

Welcome to Overreach.

Overreach is a web app that is intended to serve two main purposes:

1. Give users a place to log their strength training workouts
2. Serve as a place that users can connect with other strength training enthusiasts

The app was deployed using Heroku and can be found here: [Overreach](https://overreach.herokuapp.com)

This is my final milestone project for the Code Institute Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. In a nutshell, the goal of this milestone project is to design a full stack web application with a relational data model, business logic, user authentication and full CRUD functionality for the users.

It will be something I continue working on as a hobby/passion project (in a cloned repository) after submitting to further develop my skills in full stack software development.

## User Experience

 - ### Strategy
    The app is designed for keen weightlifters who want a simple and intuitive way of tracking and sharing their workouts and connecting with like-minded individuals. The goal for the owner of the site would be a reliable revenue stream from a happy userbase.

- ### Scope
    Users must be easily able to log a workout, complete with notes, and that data should be quickly accessible to them once they have saved it. Some key statistics from their workouts should be presented to them on their dashboard. They should also be able to see other users' profiles and workouts. Users can comment and/or like other users' workouts. It should be possible to follow specific users. An admin on the site should be easily able to see all relevant user and membership data on the Django-generated admin interface.

- ### Structure
    Everything most relevant to the user must be available in one click/tap from their dashboard once they are logged in. A user needs only click once to see a detailed feed of friends' workouts, begin logging a workout, edit profile information, see a basic feed of all users' workouts or sign out. 

- ### Skeleton
    A grid system is used to ensure clean presentation of all data on all pages to the user. Extensive use of card components from Bootstrap 4.6 was key to achieving this. Wireframes were drawn out in Balsamiq to assist in the design process, although the final app does differ slightly. The design was primarily done for use on mobile devices but it performs well on desktop or tablet devices as well.

- ### Surface
    The main colour of the logo is used as the dominant colour for elements of the surface design that need accenting. Contrasting colours are used to ensure a harmonious look across the website
